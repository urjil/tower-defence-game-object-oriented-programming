# tower-defence-game-object-oriented-programming
CS61A project

This is a project that I implemented for my CS61A class.

In this project, I created a tower defense game called Ants Vs. SomeBees. Here we have different types of ants with different power, health and special abilities and a similar 
configuration for the bees. I used OOP concepts extensively. 

DISCLAIMER: The project uses several files, but I have only made changes to ants.py, the rest of the files contain skeleton code written by the course staff.
